# MaTouch_Lite_ESP32-S3-SPI-with-Touch-3.95-ST7796

## Introduce

The MaTouch Lite 3.95 adopts an SPI screen driven by ST7796 chip with a resolution of 480×320, matched with NS2009 resistive touch screen. It is equipped with ESP32-S3 main controller, built-in 16M Flash and 8M PSRAM. Adopting SPI display design, plenty of reserved GPIOs are available for secondary development via GPIO expansion interface. It also comes with SD card interface and USB native/USB2UART port.

## Usage in Arduino IDE

- Install the Arduino IDE V1.8.19/V2.3.6
If you haven’t installed the ESP32 Board SDK yet, follow the steps in this [guide](https://wiki.makerfabs.com/Installing_ESP32_Add_on_in_Arduino_IDE.html) to get started quickly.

For the ESP32-S3 Development board version, we recommend using versions that have been verified, such as 2.0.16， which is more stable, and less prone to errors.

Note: Different computers may have different port numbers when connecting to a development board. Please select the correct port number based on the development board you are connecting to.

Please download the relevant driver libraries before using these demos.

1.Install Adafruit_BusIO v1.17.4

## Example

### LVGL_Touch

This demonstration showcases the integrated application of display and touch. The screen initially shows an image with data such as temperature, humidity, CO2, TVOC,and touch point coordinates. If the screen is not touched within 10 seconds, it will automatically turn off. After the screen turns off, clicking on it will make it bright again and display the data.

- First, connect the Mabee module to the ESP32-S3 module correctly, as shown in the figure.

- Download the library from [github](https://github.com/Makerfabs/MaTouch_Lite_ESP32-S3-SPI-with-Touch-3.95-ST7796/tree/main/example/LVGL_Touch/libraries)

Once the download is complete, copy these libraries into the Arduino library.

- The default is usually in the "C:\Users\Your username\Documents\Arduino\libraries"

**Note: If the UI, LVGL or TFT_eSPI library already exists in your Arduino libraries folder, please delete them first, then install the new version of the UI, LVGL or TFT_eSPI library.**

- Open the [LVGL_Touch](https://github.com/Makerfabs/MaTouch_Lite_ESP32-S3-SPI-with-Touch-3.95-ST7796/blob/main/example/LVGL_Touch/ui/ui.ino) by Arduino.

Connect the board to the computer using a Type-C USB data cable and via USB-TTL, and select the development board "ESP32S3 Dev Module" and the port.

- Select "Tools > board:"xxx" > ESP32 > ESP32S3 Dev Module".
- Select "Tools > Port",Select the port number of the board.
- Select Flash Size is 16MB(128MB), Partition Scheme is 16M Flash (3MB APP/9.9MB FATFS), PSRAM is OPI PSRAM.
